# PROPOSAL

As suggested by Mentor Jafsiaelisee in my first PR, I saw the need for a total rework of the Typhoid screener app. I made used of Figma Tool for designing, I showed the web view and mobile responsive view of the Typhoid screener app.

I worked with the dominant blue color of the logo and maintained the same pages but gave the UI a refreshing look and a better user experience.

## WHAT I INTEND TO DO

1. I intend to get new content for the design.
2. Get a new logo for MboaLab
3. Finish up the design with the approval of the Mentors
4. Taking feedbacks from the mentors and improving the Ui.
5. Start coding the new ui using NEXTJS and TAILWIND CSS
6. Implement the existing functionality and new functionality.
